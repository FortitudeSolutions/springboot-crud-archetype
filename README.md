# Motivation
One of the most common things I do is create RESTful CRUD data services.  This
 archetype puts all the basics in place to bring up a service like this using
 Springboot as quickly as possible.

# Goals
1. Set up a RESTful service based on Springboot
2. Service builds a docker container to run it
3. If not otherwise specified, the service uses an embedded database
4. The project should run out of the box including database resources
